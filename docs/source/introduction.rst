Introduction
============

PyFilesystem is a Python module that provides a common interface to any
filesystem.

Think of PyFilesystem ``FS`` objects as the next logical step to
Python's ``file`` objects. In the same way that file objects abstract a
single file, FS objects abstract an entire filesystem.


Installing
----------

You can install PyFilesystem with ``pip`` as follows::

    pip install fs

Or to upgrade to the most recent version::

    pip install fs --upgrade

PyFilesystem is also available on conda_::

    conda install fs -c conda-forge

Alternatively, if you would like to install from source, you can check
out `the code from Github <https://github.com/PyFilesystem/pyfilesystem2>`_.
